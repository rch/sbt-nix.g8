# sbt-nix

The only requirement to compile and run this project is [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html). You can install it with the following command:

```shell
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

To have `coursier`, `java` and `sbt` available, run `nix-shell`. Then you can use any of these packages as usual.

### Create Docker image

Note: in order to create the `base-jre`, you also need to have Docker installed as it needs to run as daemon so it cannot be provided in the `shell.nix`.

```shell
> nix-build nix/docker.nix -o result-base-jre
> docker load < result-base-jre
> sbt "docker:publishLocal"
```

Run the Docker image.

```shell
> docker run -it sbt-nix-$name$:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

### Build a binary

Running `nix-build` will pick up `default.nix`, which uses [sbt-derivation](https://github.com/zaninime/sbt-derivation).

```shell
> nix-build
```

Run the binary as follows.

```shell
> result/bin/sbt-nix-$name$
```
